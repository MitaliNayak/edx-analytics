**Acknowledgment**
===================

We, the summer interns team of edX-Data Analytics, are overwhelmed in all humbleness
and gratefulness to acknowledge our depth to all those who have helped us to put our ideas
and assigned work, well above the level of simplicity and into something concrete.

We all thank whole heartedly, **Prof. Deepak Phatak** for selecting us a part of his valuable
project, constantly motivating for doing better and showing complete confidence in our work.

We are indebted to our Project Manager, **Mr. Parag Tiwari** for his constant help and support in
light of this project. We are very thankful to our mentors **Mr. Pushpak Burange**, **Ms. Mitali Nayak** and **Mr. Praveen Pal** for their valuable suggestions, guidance and encouragement. Also in the process, we learnt a lot other technical
and non technical things from them.

We would like to thank **Mr. Mayank Paliwal** and **Mr. Rahul Kharat** for making our stay here as summer
interns comfortable and for all their administrative help.

Finally we also like to thank all other colleagues working in different projects under Prof.
Phatak for helping us at small problems as well as critical junctures.
